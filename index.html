                                    <p>Nature is the most beautiful and attractive surrounding around us which make us
                                        happy and provide us natural environment to live healthy. Our nature provides
                                        us variety of beautiful flowers, attractive birds, animals, green plants, blue
                                        sky, land, running rivers, sea, forests, air, mountains, valleys, hills and
                                        many more things. Our God has created a beautiful nature for the healthy living
                                        of us. All the things we use for our living are the assets of nature which we
                                        should not spoil and damage.

                                        We should not destroy the originality of the nature and should not imbalance
                                        the ecosystem cycle. Our nature provides us beautiful environment to live and
                                        enjoy so it is our responsibility to keep it clean and away from all the
                                        damages. In the modern era, many selfish and bad activities of the human being
                                        have disturbed the nature to a great extent. But we all should try to maintain
                                        our natureâ€™s beauty.

                <p> The footer is also sometimes the space reserved for the notes, known as footnotes. These footnotes
                    are distinguished from the notes placed at the end of a chapter or book. While in some cases the
                    footer space is generally fixed, when footnotes are added, the space will increase or decrease
                    based on the amount and length of the notes.

                    In desktop publishing applications, the footer identifies the space at the bottom of a page
